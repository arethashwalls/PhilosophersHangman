/*******************************************************************************************************
 *  Philosopher's Hangman
 *  ---------------------
 *  
 * A JavaScript game made with love by a former philosophy student, with apologies to the three or four
 * professors who dressed *exactly* like that.
 * 
 * Lines 12-193 list possible philosophers along with their associated quotes and clues. I recognize that
 * this got *kind of* out of hand, but a large possible answer set does add replay value at least.
 * 
 * Lines 197-216 set up some DOM variables and helper functions.
 * 
 * Lines 221-305 define the Hangman object.
 * 
 * Lines 310-341 define the game loop itself. 
 * 
 * Enjoy, and don't think too hard!
